# Title: Children's Math Game using python 

# Description:
The Python Math Game is an enjoyable and engaging method for children aged 5-8 to practice basic math operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The game features an easy-to-use interface and is built using the widely-used Python programming language, making it simple for players to set up and begin playing.

# Installing Python
If you don't have Python installed on your machine, you can follow the instructions below:

Visit the Python official website. Go to https://www.python.org.

Download the Python installer. Hover over the Downloads menu and click on the version that is suitable for your operating system. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Python 3.9.7 is the latest stable version.

Run the installer. After the installer is downloaded, run it. During the installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" before you click "Install Now".

# Install following commands:

pip install pillow

pip install playsound

pip install pygame

pip install pyobjc 

# Installing the Maths Game
1.	Clone the repository from Github or Download the Blue MathsGame folder by clicking the green CODE button and press Download Zip. 
2.	Verify your Python installation. You need Python installed on your computer to run this game. If you don't have Python, download it from the official website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.
3.	Check your Tkinter installation. The game uses the Tkinter library for its graphical interface. Tkinter comes pre-installed with standard Python installations. If you don't have it, you can install it using the following command:
•	For Python 3.x on Linux: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
•	For Python on Windows and MacOS, Tkinter comes pre-installed with the standard Python distribution.

# Playing the Maths Game
1.	Launch the game. You can start the game by running the Python file from the terminal or command line: python3 maths_game.py or python maths_game.py, depending on your Python installation. 0r  (Past the MathsGame file path, No need for brackets) e.g: python3 /Users/yourname/Downloads/MathsGame-main OR python /Users/yourname/Downloads/MathsGame-main Depending on your python installation.
2.	Choose a difficulty level. When the game window appears, it will show a level selection drop-down menu and an initial math problem. You can choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard levels.
3.	Solve the math problem. Enter your answer in the text field.
4.	Submit your answer. Click the "Submit" button. 
5.	The game will then give feedback by giving a point score for correct answer. If the answer is incorrect, you do not get a point. A "correct" or "incorrect" message will appear under the submit button, if you entered an incorrect answer the correct answer will be displayed.
6.	Your final score will be shown at the end of the game.
7.	Keep playing. Continue to answer problems. The game will end after you've attempted 10 questions, or 10 minutes have passed, whichever comes first.
8.	View your score. At the end of the game, your final score will be displayed. To play again, close the window and relaunch the game.

Enjoy this interactive and educational game while practicing your math skills!
