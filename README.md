# MathsGame
This repository contains a simple text-based math game designed for children aged 5-8. The game includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The game is designed to have 10 questions, and it should take about 10 minutes to complete.

## How to Run

To run the game, you'll need Python 3.x installed on your computer. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, you can run the game by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the `MathsGame.py` file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder containing the `MathsGame.py` file.
4. Run the following command:


The game will start, and you'll be asked 10 questions about addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Have fun!

## Future Enhancements

The current version of the game is text-based and not time-limited to 10 minutes. In the future, we plan to:

- Integrate the game with a graphical game engine like Pygame to create a more engaging experience for children.
- Add more difficulty levels to accommodate different age groups.
- Implement a scoring system and leaderboard to encourage competition and improvement.
- Add more game modes, such as time attack or survival mode.
