# Title: Children's Math Game using python 

# Description:
A fun and intuitive math game designed for kids aged 5-8, created with Python's Tkinter library. This game allows children to practice their math skills at different levels of difficulty - Easy, Medium, and Hard.

# Installing Python
If you don't have Python installed on your machine, you can follow the instructions below:

Visit the Python official website. Go to https://www.python.org.

Download the Python installer. Hover over the Downloads menu and click on the version that is suitable for your operating system. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Python 3.9.7 is the latest stable version.

Run the installer. After the installer is downloaded, run it. During the installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" before you click "Install Now".


# Installing the Maths Game
1.	Clone the repository from Github or Download the Blue MathsGame folder by clicking the green CODE button and press Download Zip. 
2.	Verify your Python installation. You need Python installed on your computer to run this game. If you don't have Python, download it from the official website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.
3.	Check your Tkinter installation. The game uses the Tkinter library for its graphical interface. Tkinter comes pre-installed with standard Python installations. If you don't have it, you can install it using the following command:
•	For Python 3.x on Linux: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
•	For Python on Windows and MacOS, Tkinter comes pre-installed with the standard Python distribution.

# Playing the Maths Game
1.	Launch the game. You can start the game by running the Python file from the terminal or command line: python3 maths_game_tkinter.py or python maths_game_tkinter.py, depending on your Python installation.
2.	Choose a difficulty level. When the game window appears, it will show a level selection drop-down menu and an initial math problem. You can choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard levels.
3.	Solve the math problem. Try to solve the problem displayed in the "Problem" label. Enter your answer in the text field.
4.	Submit your answer. Click the "Submit" button to check if your answer is correct or incorrect.
5.	Get feedback. The game will tell you whether your answer was correct. If it was incorrect, the game will show the correct answer.
6.	Keep playing. Continue to answer problems. The game will end after you've attempted 10 questions, or 10 minutes have passed, whichever comes first.
7.	View your score. At the end of the game, your final score will be displayed. To play again, close the window and relaunch the game.

Enjoy this interactive and educational game while practicing your math skills!
